Description: This is a Java application allowing fitness lovers and starters to set their target weight, and check if they are on the right track based on their nutrition intake and workout. This app gets input from users and does some calculations to help guide them to a healthier lifestyle. 

What user stories were completed this iteration?

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
